Instructions

Let's teach a calendar language!

The game is simple:
1. WRITE: Perform some action on the given calendar by using free-form language. Think about the actions you perform on your own calendar.
2. SCROLL & SELECT: The system will do its best to understand and show you up to 10 options, presented as new calendar states. Scroll and select the one which matches your exact intent.
3. REPHRASE: If none of the options matched your intent, try rephrasing, say it differently.
4. TEACH: If the system is not getting it, you'll have to teach it! Use the calendar interface to show exactly what you meant, and click Submit. Next time we'll get it!
